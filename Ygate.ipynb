    "### Y Gate (Pauli-Y Gate)\n",
    "The Y gate is one of the fundamental quantum gates in quantum computing. It is also known as the Pauli-Y gate. This gate performs a bit-flip and a phase-flip on the state of a qubit. For example, if the qubit is in state |0⟩, it flips it to i|1⟩, and if it is in state |1⟩, it flips it to -i|0⟩.\n",
    "Mathematically, the Y gate is represented by the following matrix:\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "Y = \\begin{pmatrix}\n",
    "0 & -i \\\\\n",
    "i & 0\n",
    "\\end{pmatrix}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "#### Properties of the Y Gate\n",
    "1. **Involutory:** Applying the Y gate twice returns the qubit to its original state. Mathematically, $Y^2 = I$, where $I$ is the identity matrix.  ,\n",
    "2. **Hermitian:** The Y gate is its own inverse and its own conjugate transpose, i.e., $Y = Y^\\dagger$.\n",
    "3. **Determinant:** The determinant of the Y gate is -1.\n",
    "#### Quantum Circuit Representation \n",
    "In a quantum circuit, the Y gate is represented as follows:\n",
    "```\n",
    "──Y──\n",
    "```  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see an example of how to use the X gate in a quantum circuit using the Cirq library:\n"
